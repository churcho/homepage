# For production, we often load configuration from external sources, such as
# your system environment. For this reason, you won't find the :http
# configuration below, but set inside ClientWeb.Endpoint.init/2 when
# load_from_system_env is true. Any dynamic configuration should be done there.
#
# Don't forget to configure the url host to something meaningful, Phoenix uses
# this information when generating URLs.
#
# Finally, we also include the path to a cache manifest containing the digested
# version of static files. This manifest is generated by the mix phx.digest
# task which you typically run after static files are built.
